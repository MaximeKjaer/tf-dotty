Today, tf-dotty is open-sourced ðŸŽ‰

There is some documentation of the code and approach on this site. Many things are still bound to change, but do not hesitate to open an issue on [the repo](https://github.com/MaximeKjaer/tf-dotty).

This is still a very early version of tf-dotty; it is not published on Maven, and is not intended for production. However, a general approach to typing multi-dimensional arrays (e.g. tensors) is here, and I'm open-sourcing it for other people to experiment with.
